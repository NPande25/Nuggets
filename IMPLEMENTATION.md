# CS50 Nuggets
## Implementation Spec
### CecsC (Team 17), Spring, 2023


According to the [Requirements Spec](REQUIREMENTS.md), the Nuggets game requires two standalone programs: a client and a server.
Our implementation also includes `player`, `grid`, and `gridcell` modules.
We describe each program and module separately.
We do not describe the `support` library nor the modules that enable features that go beyond the spec.
We avoid repeating information that is provided in the requirements spec.

### Bonus Functionality
As a non-spectator player of the game, if you "step" on top of another player's character, you steal 10% of their gold that they have, none if they have no gold. It also displays a message to both the theif and the victim, detailing how much gold was stolen, and their remaining total gold.


The modules that are affected are the `server` module, and the `client` module.


Functions affected:


The `static bool moveOnMap(player_t* player, int newX, int newY)` function within the `server` module has added logic that checks whether another player has been stepped on, and if so, calculates 10% of the other player's gold and transfers it to the player doing the motion.


Pseudocode:


#### `moveOnMap`:
```
if player is active
   get player coordinates
   get gridcell player is in (curCell) and gridcell of cell they are trying to move to (newCell)
   get the player's character
   if both cells are not null
       get char of newCell(newChar)
       if newChar is an uppercase letter
           swap the letters in newCell and curCell
           give 10% of gold from player stepped on to mover
           return true
       else if newChar is '*'
           get amount of gold in pile
           add gold amount to player's score
           subtract gold in pile from game's remaining gold
           move player to new position
           change char in old position to '.' or '*'
           send GOLD message to player
           return true
       else if newChar is '.' or '*'
           move player to new position
           change char in old position to '.' or '*'
           return true
return false
```

## Player


### Data structures


bool* boolGrid
boolGrid is a 1d array of booleans aligning with the main map, where each boolean is true if the corresponding character on the map has been seen by the player, false otherwise


struct grid_t
Grid_t contains a 1d array of gridcells, each representing a character on the map that the players move on.


### Definition of function prototypes


The `player` module implements several functions.


`player_new` creates a new player


`player_playerVisibility` updates a player's visibility grid (boolGrid) based on the main grid after each player moves.


`player_get_string` takes the current grid and print out the string map that the specific player sees themselves.


`player_delete` deletes a `player_t` struct.


Then, the module implements a series of getters and setters for various members of the `player_t` struct, which are:
* `player_get_addr`
* `player_get_boolGrid`
* `player_get_c`
* `player_get_name`
* `player_get_score`
* `player_get_x`
* `player_get_y`
* `player_is_active`
* `player_set_c`
* `player_set_name`
* `player_set_score`
* `player_set_boolGrid`
* `player_set_x`
* `player_set_y`
* `player_deactivate`




Function prototypes:
```c
player_t* player_new(char c, const char* name, const addr_t addr, int NR, int NC);
void player_delete(player_t* player);
void player_playerVisibility(player_t* player, grid_t* grid);
addr_t player_get_addr(player_t* player);
bool player_get_boolGrid(player_t* player, int index);
char player_get_c(player_t* player);
const char* player_get_name(player_t* player);
int player_get_score(player_t* player);
int player_get_x(player_t* player);
int player_get_y(player_t* player);
bool player_is_active(player_t* player);
void player_set_c(player_t* player, char c);
void player_set_name(player_t* player, char* name);
void player_set_score(player_t* player, int score);
void player_set_boolGrid(player_t* player, int index, bool visible);
void player_set_x(player_t* player, int x);
void player_set_y(player_t* player, int y);
void player_deactivate(player_t* player);
char* player_get_string(player_t* player, grid_t* grid);
```


### Detailed pseudo code


#### `player_new`
```
allocate for player
allocate for boolGrid
for each index in boolGrid
   set to false
initialize each member of player
return the player
```


#### `player_playerVisibility`:
```
for each gridcell in the main map grid
   checks if each cell is visable from the player's current position
   if yes, mark that index as true
   if not, mark as false
```


#### `player_delete`
```
free the boolGrid
free the player struct
```


#### `player_get_string`:
```
for each gridcell in the main map grid
   if the gridcell is visible to player
       if it is gold
           if the player can currently seen it
               show the gold
           otherwise show it as an empty room space
       else if it is the player's character
           show it as @ symbol
       otherwise, print the gridcell as it comes
```


## Grid




### Definition of function prototypes


`grid` implements several functions in `grid.c`:


`grid_new`, creates a new `grid_t` struct.


`grid_get_NR` returns the number of rows.


`grid_get_NC` returns the number of columns.


`grid_get_gridarray` returns the gridcell in the gridarray at a specified index.


`grid_get_map` returns the map, a char* string in the grid that holds the map.


`grid_load` loads a grid from a file specified by the path name. The file represents a grid where each character in the file corresponds to a cell in the grid.


`grid_update_map` updates the map string after it has changed, when a player has moved


`grid_set` changes the character at a certain location in the grid.
`grid_print` prints the char* map of the grid. This is mostly used for testing/debugging purposes. For the game, we have more sophisticated `get_string` methods.


`grid_iterate` iterates over all the gridcells in the grid.


`grid_isVisible` is the base visibility function for the game. It determines whether a target gridcell is visible from a player gridcell.


`grid_generateGold` creates a random number of gold piles in a grid, between minPiles and maxPiles.


`grid_delete` deletes the `grid_t` struct.


```c
grid_t* grid_new();
void grid_load(grid_t* grid, char* pathName);
int grid_get_NR(grid_t* grid);
int grid_get_NC(grid_t* grid);
gridcell_t* grid_get_gridarray(grid_t* grid, int idx);
char* grid_get_map(grid_t* grid);
void grid_set(grid_t* grid, int x, int y, char c);
void grid_print(grid_t* grid);
void grid_update_map(grid_t* grid);
void grid_iterate(grid_t* grid, void* arg, void (*itemfunc)(void* arg, void* item));
bool grid_isVisible(grid_t* grid, gridcell_t* player, gridcell_t* target);
void grid_generateGold(grid_t* grid, int minPiles, int maxPiles, int goldTotal);
void grid_delete(grid_t* grid );

### Data Structures
#### gridcell_t
The `grid_t` struct also uses `gridcell_t`, a struct that represents one specific cell in the grid. The gridcell struct holds certain members in it, which include:


```c
typedef struct gridcell {
 char c;                       // actual makeup of cell
 int x;                        // x position in grid
 int y;                        // y position in grid
 int gold;                     // amount of gold in place, 0 if none
 bool show;                    // if cell can be seen by player or not
 bool room;                    // is the gridcell is a room?
 bool isWall;                  // is the gridcell a wall?
} gridcell_t;
```


The struct also implements getter and setter functions for each of these members.


## Server


### Data structures


`gameData` is a local structure used to store game data, including the master grid, array of players, number of players, the address of the spectator, a boolean of whether or not there is a spectator, the number of remaining gold, the number of rows, the number of columns, and the address of the player that just found gold. An instance of gameData is created as a global variable.


```c
struct gameData {
   grid_t* map;
   player_t* allPlayers[26];
   addr_t spect;
   bool hasSpect;
   int numPlayers;
   int numGold;
   int numRows;
   int numCols;
   addr_t justFoundGold;
};
```


Within `gameData`, the structures *grid_t*, *player_t*, and *addr_t* are also used. The grid is used to store the game map, the player is used to create the player array, and address is used to store the addresses of players/spectator. More details about grid and player can be found above. *addr_t* was provided in the message module in the support library.


### Definition of function prototypes


`main` accepts command-line arguments, initializes global gameData variable, initializes the message module, and calls the message_loop function.


`parseArgs` parses and validates the command-line arguments, extracting the map file name and seed if given.


`handleMessage` handles incoming messages from clients and calls appropriate methods based on game logic.


`addPlayer` creates a new player and adds them to the player array in the global gameData struct.


`addSpectator` creates a spectator and stores their client address in the global gameData struct.


`handleKey` uses switch cases to pass appropriate parameters to moveOnMap based on which key player presses and where they want to move.


`moveOnMap` changes the game map based on parameters passed to it by handleKey.


`handleQuit` deactivates a player or spectator if they press the "Q" key.


`dropGold` drops a random number of gold piles (between minimum and maximum number of gold piles) in the map.


`updatePlayers` sends GOLD and DISPLAY messages to the clients of all the players.


`updateSpectator` sends GOLD and DISPLAY messages to the spectator if there is one.


`gameOver` creates the game summary and sends it as a message to all clients.


Function prototypes:
```c
int main (const int argc, char* argv[]);
static bool handleMessage(void* arg, const addr_t from, const char* message);
static void parseArgs(const int argc, char* argv[], char** mapFileName, int* seed);
static void addPlayer(addr_t from, const char* name);
static void addSpectator(addr_t from);
static void handleKey(player_t* player, const char* key);
static bool moveOnMap(player_t* player, int newX, int newY);
static void handleQuit(player_t* player);
static void dropGold();
static void updatePlayers();
static void updateSpectator();
static void gameOver();

## Client


### Data structures


> For each new data structure, describe it briefly and provide a code block listing the `struct` definition(s).
> No need to provide `struct` for existing CS50 data structures like `hashtable`.


The client uses one data structure that is used as a static global variable, the `data` struct, that is used for convenience to store game critical information only received once from the server. The `data` construct contains three variables, `int NROWS` and `int NCOLS` that store the required window size passed from the server and `char player` which is a flag to indicate spectator functionality if zero and an alphabetical character if storing player’s tag as seen by the server otherwise.


The client also uses the `addr_t` struct declared by `message.h` in the support module.


### Definition of function prototypes


> For function, provide a brief description and then a code block with its function prototype.
> For example:


stdin has input ready (cbreak mode), reads a char and sends it to the server.
Returns true if the message loop should exit, such as during an error, and otherwise returns false.
```c
static bool handleInput(void* arg);
```


Receive datagrams from server at addr_t `from`, `message` is parsed with the use of helper functions
```c
static bool handleMessage(void* arg, const addr_t from, const char* message);
```


Fills data’s player field with value depending on player or spectator response type from server
```c
handleOK(const char* message);
```                      */
Parses message from server expecting GRID %d %d syntax, verifies that CURSES window is at least the required size, prompting the user to resize if not.
```c
static bool handleGRID(const char* message);
```


Parses message of type GOLD %d %d %d, displays gold values in the topline of CURSES window. If the display line is longer than the window, it is cropped.
```c
static bool handleGOLD(const char* message);
```


Parses message from server of the type DISPLAY\nstring, displays the chars following '\n' character in a CURSES window.
```c
static void handleDISPLAY(const char* message);
```


Initializes curses, creating window, gathering window size, and setting terminal to appropriate settings
```c
static void initialize_curses(); // CURSES
```


Fills ncurses screen with bank character ' '
```c
static void init_map();
```


Display the map (char* display) into CURSES screen
```c
static void display_map(char* display);
```


display temp status message to the right of the gold status message
```c
static void display_temp_message(const char* temp);
```


clears temp status message to the right of the gold status message
```c
static void clear_temp_message();
```


allocates memory for data struct, initializes to default values
```c
static data_t* data_new();
```

## Testing plan


### unit testing
We tested the modules in the ‘player’ library. We implemented a ‘gridtest.c’ file, whose output is documented in ‘gridtest.out’, which tests the loading and printing of various grids. We also implemented a ‘visibilitytest.c’, whose output is documented in ‘visibilitytest.out’, which tests the functionality of visibility in the ‘grid’ module. It loads the ‘visdemo’ grid and creates various gridcells, testing visibility between them. To run both testing files with Val grind, run ‘make test’ in the player directory.


### integration testing
We will test the complete main programs by first connecting our server with the given client code, then debugging with the correct client so we know the issues lie within the server. Once we have the server up to specs, we will use the given server to debug our client code, starting with sending simple messages between our client and their server.


Our client was tested by connecting it to the example server provided to us. We also tested it by hand by playing the game with valgrind evoked from the command line. No memory leaks were found except for those created by NCURSES. 

### system testing
Once both our server and client are up to specs, we will run the server and connect our own version of the client to it. We will play the game and locate and fix any errors.
